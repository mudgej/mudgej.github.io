<h1>Nitrox Bank / Compressor Blending Calculator Notes / Known Issues / Future Fixes</h1>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>All calculations are rounded floating point numbers - you may therefore notice some answers appear to be around 1 bar off if compared to other calculators. In most cases, this level of precision is however irrelevant.</li>
  <li>The user can input numbers that are illogical and therefore gain illogical answers from the calculator. A future version will fix this issue.</li>
  <li>Although the calculator can be used with fill mixes up to 100%, the gas cost calculator always calculates the cost using the nitrox price, not the 100% o2 price.</li>
  <li>The gas cost calculator could be subject to minor rounding errors. Please do not chase me or be surprised if your bill is a few pence different.</li>
